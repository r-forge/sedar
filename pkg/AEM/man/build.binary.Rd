\title{ Function to construct a site-by-edge binary matrix }
\description{
  This function construct a site-by-edge binary matrix. It uses a set of sites coordinates and a connexion diagram (object of class nb, define in the library spdep). 1 represents the presence of a link influencing a site, directly or indirectly, otherwise 0. The process is considered to be going from the bottom to the top of the map; so, the origin is underneath the set of points representing the sites. Prepare the table of site coordinates accordingly.
  The lowest site(s) in the gradient are the ones that will connect to the fictitious site 0 to consider direction.

\usage{
build.binary(nb.object=NULL, coords,link=NULL, unit.angle = "degrees", rot.angle = 0, rm.same.y = TRUE, plot.connexions = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{nb.object}{ Object of class \code{nb} from library spdep. }
  \item{coords}{ A three columns matrix or data frame. Colums 1: identifiers of the points (needs to be numeric). Columns 2 and 3: the X and Y coordinates of the points.}
  \item{link}{ A two columns matrix. Each row define an edge. Column 1: The site from which the edge starts. Column 2: the site to which the edge ends. All values in \code{link} need to be integers. }
  \item{unit.angle}{ Character. The measurement units in which the angle is defined: either "degrees" (default) or "radians". }
  \item{rot.angle}{ Numeric. Angle of the vector describing the process influencing the sites. This argument generate a rotation of the site coordinates. The set of coordinates is rotated counterclockwise. Negative values will produce a clockwise rotation.}
  \item{rm.same.y}{ Logical (\code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE}). Determines if the links perpendicular to the gradient should be removed. Default value: \code{TRUE}. If these links have already been removed this argument put to \code{TRUE} will make the function crash. See detail for more information. }
  \item{plot.connexions}{ Logical (\code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE}). Determines if the sites and the associated connexion diagram should be plotted after rotation of the coordinates by \code{gradient.angle}. }
}

\details{
  The site-by-edge matrix created by this function and the list of edges include the links associated to a fictitious site upstream of all other, see Blanchet et al. (In press), for details. The decision regarding wether the origin and the edges associated with it should be kept or removed is left to the user. Removal of this site and of its associated edges can be done manually after the construction of the site-by-edge matrix and of the list edges. It can also be done when running the function \code{\link{aem}}.
  
  If the connexion diagram was modified so that the links connecting sites that are exactly perpendicular to the gradient have been removed or if there is no sites exactly at the same level in the gradient, defining \code{rm.same.y} to \code{TRUE} will generate an error.
  
  If all the sites have the same y coordinates after rotation, e.g. a horizontal transect perpendicular to the defined spatial asymmetry, this analysis should not be used.
  
  The argument \code{plot.connexions} will plot the sites (\code{coords}) in black, after rotation, if any, and the connexion diagram (\code{nb.object}), in red. The site labels are also plotted on the graph. To show the direction of the spatial asymmetry considered by the function, a fictive site (in blue) was added upstream. This fictive site is linked (blue edges) to the site(s) that are the most upstream ones. Since this graph is generic, it might sometimes look odd, however, the information given will remain the accurate.

\value{
  \item{se.mat }{A binary (n x k) matrix of site (n rows) by link edges (k columns).}
  \item{edges }{A matrix describing the link edges. It has 2 columns (from, to) and as many rows as there are edges. The edges linked to the fictitious site of origin are found at the beginning of the list.}
