# LONG TERM
==========================
==========================
* simple heuristic reserve selection algorithms (greedy, progressive rarity) for evaluating performance of 'beta diversity' measures (contribution diversity approach) in reserve selection. Spatial constraints (reserve design principles) might be added later. (More advanced topics??? simulated annealing, benefit functions, ...)

* methods for spatial representation (mapping) of 'mefa' objects. And also plug-ins for 'mefa' objects to enable consistency with 'sedar' functions, and ade4 and vegan functionalities.
