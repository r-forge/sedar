ChangeLog for mefaspat package in the sedar project

Version 1.0-1 (opened June 9, 2008)

    * betaols: proper print and summary methods are written, plot method
    is modified to show locations for comparison on the x axis.

    * permatsar: individual based community matrix permutation algorithm
    complementing permatfull and permatswap functions in the vegan package,
    permatsar is based on prabclus functions for autocorrelated abundances.

    * nbmc: neighbourhood lists fo different metacommunity models, based on
    discrete region and habitat classes.

Version 1.0 (opened June 5, 2008, closed June 9, 2008)

	* xytrend: function moved from 'mefa' to sedar, computes polynoimial ters for
    spatial variables.

	* betaols (object class & S3 methods): written for test the difference of
	regression parameters between distance matrices (beta diversity indices
	vs. spatial distances) for two non overlaping sets of species.
