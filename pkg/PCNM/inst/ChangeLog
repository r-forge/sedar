	* New data set: trichoptera.rda
	
	* PCNM.R: small changes.

	now in vegan release.
	
Version 1.8

	* PCNM.R: added computation of Moran's I for the computed PCNMs.
	
Version 1.7

	* dbMEM option added to PCNM.R to compute db-MEM eigenfunctions.

	* PCNM.R transfers a parameter 'diagonal' to pcoa.all.R.

Version 1.6

	* Fixes in Rd files to pass R-devel parser 2 check, and cleaning
	of some Rd entries.

	* added this ChangeLog.

	* PL & DB crosschecked the functions and fixed diffuse places in
	pcoa.R, pcoa.all.R, and quickPCNM.R.  Documentation updated.

	* Added anova.ccabyaxis.R from vegan (against JO's ideals of

Version 1.5

	* Minor fixes in PCNM.R and pcoa.Rd.  

	* quickPCNM.R: a quick temporary fix to pass 'cutoff' to
