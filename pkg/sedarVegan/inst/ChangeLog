This file containts information about visible changes in
sedarVegan for developers (others and yourself). Add new entries to the 
top of the file using version numbering defined in DESCRIPTION. 

Version 0.2-0 (opened February 8, 2011)

	* pcnm: remove from sedarVegan because is now in vegan.

	* R CMD check did not allow detaching conflicting ade4 in
	BCI.xy.Rd, and the file also needed to be adjusted for the removal
	of pcnm.R.

Version 0.1-2 (closed February 8, 2011)

	* pcnm: gained argument for row weights allowing derivation of
	weighted orthogonal PCNM's to be used with CCA.
	
Version 0.1-1 (closed October 14, 2008)

	* BCI.xy: added data set on spatial coordinates of the BCI plots,
	with examples on cca and mso.
	
Version 0.1-0 (closed June 19, 2008)

	* chooseCN: veganified Jombart's chooseCN function. The major
	changes were that the function is silent and does not ask user
	interaction, and that plotting (and printing) is separated from
	calculation. I made this change only to demonstrate the difference
	in vegan and ade4 programming style, and the proper function
	really is Thibaut Jombert's code. Function uses eiter ade4 or
	vegan for minimum spanning tree so that it works with either
	package. 

	* pcnm: veganified Stephane Dray's spacemakeR/pcnm function, so
	that it can use either vegan spantree or ade4 mstree. Some
	reorganization and stylistic changes within the code, and finding
	of truncation distance was embedded in the function instead of
	using a separate function. The result also got class "pcnm", but
	there are no methods yet.
	
version 0.0-1 (closed June 2, 2008)

	* setting up sedarVegan with only one function: spantree2neig
          to translate vegan::spantree objects to ade4::neig objects.
